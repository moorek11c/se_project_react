# What to Wear

## Overview

**What to Wear** is a React application that provides clothing recommendations based on the current weather. The app fetches weather data from a weather API and suggests appropriate clothing items that can be added to a MongoDB database.

This project consists of both a front-end (this repository) and a back-end, which handles the database and API logic. The back-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/moorek11c/se_project_express.git).
